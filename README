This PHP class provides a basic implementation of the Google Calendar API (v2.1) 
which you can use within your own web application. While this class doesn't implement
all of the features of the Google Calendar API, it serves as a light weight alternative
which can get you started and perform the most basic operations on a Google Calendar.
